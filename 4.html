For the 60th Venice Biennale, the Korean Pavilion presents ODORAMA CITIES by artist KOO JEONG A. 
In this exhibition, the artist delves into the nuances of our spatial encounters, investigating how we perceive and recollect spaces, 
with a particular emphasis on how scents, smells, and odors contribute to these memories.
