Koreans understand that food is not just for nutrition but also for mental and emotional well-being. 
Not only do Koreans see nutritious food as a cure for some illnesses and ailments, but also as a preventative. 
To achieve health benefits holistically in traditional Korean foods, Koreans believe that food should be harmonious. 
Much like Japanese culture, there is a belief in the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and wood) and yin and yang all contributing to the presentation and taste of food. 
These five elements are present in five tastes (spicy, sour, bitter, sweet and salty) and five colours (red, yellow, black, white and blue).
